1,Data Scientist,(Glassdoor est.),"At Density, we build one of the most advanced people sensing systems in the world. The product and infrastructure is nuanced and one-of-a-kind. Building this product for scale has been an exercise in patience, creativity, remarkable engineering, laser physics, global logistics, and grit. The team is thoughtful, driven, and world-class.
We build systems that are real-time, accurate, and anonymous by design. Our systems help today’s largest companies understand how their buildings get used. We have counted hundreds of millions of people.
Counting people in “real-time” is unique and particularly hard to achieve. It allows a user to walk into a room, beneath our sensor, and see the room’s occupancy increment 700ms later.
Today alone, Density will ingest over 1m events. In the coming year, our sensor network is on track to grow ten-fold. The overall system load is exploding. Maintaining our low latency standards requires an increasingly thoughtful system.
We’re architecting infrastructure where annual, unscheduled downtime is measured in minutes. We’re building intelligent redundancies so missed events are an oddity. We’re constructing an exceptional engineering team to support always-on, intelligible analytics generated on the fly.
This role reports to our Director of Data Science & Engineering.
As a at Density, you will work on algorithms developed for applications deployed on state-of-the-art remote devices as well as our cloud platform. The data you will work with includes ToF depth data, point clouds from radar, and device parameters. Algorithms include computer vision segmentation identification, 3D point cloud surface analysis, and optimization algorithms for sensor tuning. Join a team of experienced data scientists as we expand what is possible.",4.7,"Density Inc.
